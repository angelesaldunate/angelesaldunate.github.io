I'm in the final year of a Msci at Universidad de Los Andes. My work is focused on applying deep learning models in different fields such as marketing, healthcare, and traffic. I was admitted as a research assistant at the data science group of Complex Systems Engineering Institute of Chile. Here I worked with my Thesis advisors [Carla Vairetti](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VPQYt1IAAAAJ&hl=es) and [Sebastián Maldonado](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=Qzl7WeYAAAAJ&hl=en).

Now I'm a research assistant in HAPLAB [https://haplab.org/](https://haplab.org/ "https://haplab.org/") . Here I’m collaborating in research that co-design health applications for the elderly. I’m also leading research that improves communication of people that suffer from ALS using natural language processing. I work mainly with [Valeria Herskovic](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hZvxhjYAAAAJ&hl=es) as a guide.

Also, I’m participating in a startup that a friend of mine is managing called Snow Consulting. Is a startup that gives AI/BI solutions to contact centers, including data mining and BI, transcription (speech to text/ text to speech), omnichannel optimization, text mining, and chatbots. I advise on what AI technology we use while I research NLP/NLU to improve text classification and dialog systems in Spanish and omnichannel optimization.

Previously, I studied Software Engineering at Universidad de Los Andes. Find my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mgevi1Tq4k3lHD2zQ4L4YRy3BVg-mOVd/view?usp=sharing).

I'm from Chile and I love climbing, hiking, and any team sport (I'm not necessarily good ;) but the spirit is what counts).

Both in my undergrad and Msci I was the only female student. That's why I’m actively involved in an [ONG ](https://ninaspro.cl/)that empowers girls and teaches them programming abilities to lower the gender gap in STEM careers. We do this by encouraging the participation and training girls to do well in the National Olympic Programming Contest. Meanwhile, we do talks and conferences to make noticeable women and show the girls role models that are dedicated to STEM.

Breaking any kind of barriers in society is what motivates me. Language barriers, lack of accessibility from disabilities, the gender gap, race, ethnicity, name one. I use machine learning and my time to achieve this goal in any way I can. One step at a time.
